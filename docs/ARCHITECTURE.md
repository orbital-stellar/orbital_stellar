## 1. System overview

Orbital is three planes sharing one vocabulary - the **normalized event**:

- **Subscription plane** - `@orbital-stellar/pulse-core` opens and maintains
  connections to Stellar (Horizon SSE and Stellar RPC for Soroban contract
  events), normalizes raw operations into a typed `NormalizedEvent` union, and
  routes each event to per-address `Watcher` subscribers.
- **Delivery plane** - `@orbital-stellar/pulse-webhooks` attaches to a `Watcher`,
  signs each event with HMAC-SHA256, and POSTs it to one or more HTTPS
  endpoints with retry, timeout, and SSRF safety. A second export
  (`verifyWebhookEdge`) lets receivers verify the signature on Cloudflare
  Workers, Vercel Edge, Deno, and browsers without Node `crypto`.
- **Consumption plane** - `@orbital-stellar/pulse-notify` opens a browser
  `EventSource` to a backend that re-emits the events as Server-Sent
  Events, and re-renders React components on each event.

Each plane is independently installable from npm and independently

demo at `apps/web/app/api/events/[address]/route.ts` shows all three wired
together inside a single Next.js route handler - about 50 lines of glue.

## 2.1 ABI Registry (`@orbital-stellar/abi-registry`)

`@orbital-stellar/abi-registry` is the shared contract-interface package for Orbital.

- It holds the canonical ABI client surface for Soroban event decoding and publishing.
- It keeps ABI-related helpers in one place instead of duplicating schema logic in `pulse-core` or application code.
- It exposes the registry-facing building blocks the rest of the repo consumes: `AbiRegistryClient`, `RegistryPublisher`, `LocalFilePublisher`, `scvalToJs`, and `jsToScval`.
- It is the MIT package surface. The hosted registry service described in `docs/open-source-policy.md` is a separate product boundary.

The package-level reference lives in [`packages/abi-registry/README.md`](../packages/abi-registry/README.md).

Above decode sits the **semantic layer** — taxonomy mappings (e.g.
`transfer` → `token.transferred`, `swap` → `swap.executed`) and entity
labels (contract → protocol / issuer). Unmapped events stay unmapped; the
layer never guesses a name. Full explanation and a live mainnet worked
example: [`docs/semantic-layer.md`](./semantic-layer.md).

## 3. Event lifecycle

End-to-end for a single payment event from on-chain to React render:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Network as Stellar network
  participant Engine as EventEngine
  participant Normalizer as normalize()
  participant Registry as Watcher registry
  participant Webhooks as WebhookDelivery
  participant Hook as useStellarEvent
  participant Endpoint as Your HTTPS endpoint
  participant App as React app

  Network->>Engine: SSE operation record
  Engine->>Normalizer: route record by type
  Normalizer-->>Engine: NormalizedEvent (payment.received)
  Engine->>Registry: route(event)
  Registry->>Webhooks: watcher.emit("payment.received", event)
  Registry->>Hook: SSE message → setState
  Webhooks->>Endpoint: POST { x-orbital-signature, x-orbital-timestamp, body }
  Endpoint-->>Webhooks: 200 OK
  Hook->>App: re-render with new event
```

Steps in detail:

1. **Subscribe.** Caller invokes `engine.subscribe(address)`. The engine
   creates a new `Watcher` (or returns an existing one), registers a
   `stopHandler` for cleanup, and stores any optional `filter` predicate.
2. **Ingest.** Horizon streams an operation record. The engine's `onmessage`
   callback updates `lastEventAt` and asks the normalizer to map the record
   to a `NormalizedEvent`. Records that don't match any known op type are
   dropped silently; records that fail field validation are dropped with a
   warn log.
3. **Route.** Each event type has a routing rule encoded in
   `EventEngine.route()`. Payments route to both `from` and `to` watchers;
   account merges to source and destination; trust-auth events to issuer and
   trustor; claimables to every claimant plus the sponsor. The same event
   never delivers to the same watcher twice.
4. **Filter.** If the subscriber passed a `filter` predicate, the engine
   calls it; a `false` return suppresses delivery. A thrown predicate is
   treated as `false` and logged as a warning - the stream stays up.
5. **Emit.** The watcher emits the event under its discriminated type
   (`"payment.received"`) and also under the wildcard `"*"`. Consumers can
   listen to either or both.
6. **Deliver.** Any `WebhookDelivery` attached to the watcher signs the
   payload, POSTs it, and handles retry on failure. Any `useStellarEvent`
   hook attached via SSE receives the event and updates React state.

---

## 4. The normalization layer

Horizon's operation records are denormalized JSON keyed by operation type.
`pulse-core` exposes them as a single discriminated union so consumers can
exhaustively switch on `event.type`:

```ts
type NormalizedEvent =
  | PaymentEvent
  | AccountOptionsEvent
  | AccountCreatedEvent
  | TrustlineEvent
  | AccountMergeEvent
  | OfferEvent
  | BumpSequenceEvent
  | DataEvent
  | ClaimableCreatedEvent
  | ClaimableClaimedEvent
  | LiquidityPoolDepositEvent
  | LiquidityPoolWithdrawEvent
  | TrustAuthEvent;
```

The 13 Horizon operation types map to **21 normalized event types** - the
difference comes from operations that fan out into multiple semantic events
(a `change_trust` becomes one of `trustline.added`, `trustline.removed`, or
`trustline.updated` depending on the new limit; a `manage_sell_offer` becomes
one of `offer.created`, `offer.updated`, or `offer.deleted` depending on the
offer ID and amount).

Asset encoding is normalized to a single string: `"XLM"` for native, or
`"CODE:ISSUER"` for credit assets. This sidesteps the Horizon convention of
`asset_type` + `asset_code` + `asset_issuer` triples in every operation.

The full taxonomy is documented in
[`packages/pulse-core/README.md`](../packages/pulse-core/README.md#event-taxonomy)
and the per-event TypeScript shapes live in
[`packages/pulse-core/src/index.ts`](../packages/pulse-core/src/index.ts).

## 4.1 Unified event ingestion (CAP-67) 🛠️

Protocol 23's CAP-67 lets classic asset movements (transfer, mint, burn,
clawback, `set_authorized`) emit Soroban-format events in a single stream,
fetched the same way contract events already are - `SorobanRpcClient.getEvents()`.
This is a third transport alongside Horizon SSE and the Soroban contract-event
subscriber, tracked as Wave 1.6 in [`ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md) and designed
in [`docs/design/cap67-mapping.md`](./design/cap67-mapping.md) (see also
[`docs/CAP-67-Event-Mapping.md`](./CAP-67-Event-Mapping.md) for the taxonomy
rationale). As of this writing the pieces below exist as independent,
tested building blocks; wiring them into `EventEngine`'s live delivery path -
so a family routed to "unified" actually stops arriving via Horizon and
starts arriving via the unified stream instead - is still forthcoming.

**Ingestion mode.** `CoreConfig.ingestion?: "unified" | "horizon" | "auto"`
(default `"horizon"`) selects a transport preference. `"horizon"` is the
default specifically so that existing consumers see zero behavior change
until they opt in. `"auto"` is meant to prefer `"unified"` once the
configured Soroban RPC is confirmed CAP-67-capable, falling back to
`"horizon"` otherwise. The flag is validated at construction (an unknown
value throws) and reported back via `engine.status().ingestion`.

**Routing decision.** Not every event family has a CAP-67 equivalent - per
the mapping design doc, only classic payments (transfer/mint/burn) and
trustline authorization (`set_authorized`) do. Everything else (account
options, account creation, account merges, trustline limit changes, offers,
bump-sequence, `manage_data`, claimable balances, liquidity pools) has no
unified-stream equivalent and stays Horizon-only under every mode.
`resolveFamilyTransport(family, effectiveMode)` is the pure function
encoding this:

| Event family | Under `"horizon"` mode | Under `"unified"` mode |
|---|---|---|
| `payment` (transfer/mint/burn) | Horizon | Unified |
| `trustlineAuth` (`set_authorized`) | Horizon | Unified |
| `trustlineLimit`, `accountCreated`, `accountOptions`, `accountMerge`, `offer`, `bumpSequence`, `manageData`, `claimableBalance`, `liquidityPool` | Horizon | Horizon |

`"auto"` mode is designed to resolve to one of the two columns above (never
a third behavior) based on the CAP-67-capability probe described above -
that probe isn't implemented yet, so `"auto"` currently behaves like
`"horizon"` in practice.

**Dedupe window.** During a routing transition - a mode switch, or `"auto"`
falling back and recovering - both transports can briefly observe the same
on-chain movement, which would otherwise reach a `Watcher` twice.
`deriveDedupeKey({ txHash, index })` derives one key per movement regardless
of which transport observed it (a Horizon operation and a CAP-67 event both
carry a transaction hash; `index` is the operation's position in the tx, or
the unified event's ordinal). `DedupeWindow` holds a bounded set of
recently-seen keys ahead of `Watcher` fan-out - `seenBefore(key)` returns
`true` for a duplicate, and the oldest key is evicted once the window is at
capacity, so memory never grows unbounded no matter how long the engine runs.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  HorizonOp["Horizon operation"] --> Route
  UnifiedEvt["CAP-67 unified event"] --> Route
  Route{"resolveFamilyTransport<br/>(family, mode)"} --> Normalize["normalize()"]
  Normalize --> Dedupe{"DedupeWindow<br/>.seenBefore(txHash:index)"}
  Dedupe -->|first time| Watcher["Watcher fan-out"]
  Dedupe -->|duplicate| Drop(["dropped"])
```

A COOKBOOK recipe for migrating an existing Horizon-only deployment onto
unified ingestion, once live routing lands, is planned but not yet written.

## 5. Reconnection, backoff, and rate limits

Horizon's SSE stream is not durable. Network blips, process restarts, and
upstream maintenance windows all surface as `onerror` callbacks. The
reconnection state machine is the single most load-bearing piece of
`pulse-core` for production reliability.

### Backoff policy

The engine uses **AWS Full Jitter**: each reconnect delay is a uniform random
value between `0` and `min(initialDelayMs × 2^(attempt-1), maxDelayMs)`. This
avoids the thundering-herd problem where every dropped client reconnects on
the same millisecond when Horizon comes back.

Defaults: `initialDelayMs: 1000`, `maxDelayMs: 30000`, `maxRetries: ∞`. All
three are overridable via `CoreConfig.reconnect`.

### Rate-limit handling

A `429 Too Many Requests` response is not treated as a generic error. The
engine parses the `Retry-After` header (either integer seconds or an HTTP
date), schedules the reconnect for exactly that delay, and emits an
`engine.rate_limited` notification on every watcher so consumers can show
banners or pause publishers. If the header is missing or malformed, the
engine falls back to a 60-second delay (longer than the exponential default).

### Lifecycle notifications

Every watcher receives lifecycle notifications alongside operation events:

| Notification | When |
|---|---|
| `engine.reconnecting` | Backoff delay started; will reconnect in `delayMs` |
| `engine.reconnected` | Reconnect succeeded on attempt `N` |
| `engine.rate_limited` | 429 received; reconnect deferred by `delayMs` |
| `engine.stopped` | `engine.stop()` was called explicitly |
| `engine.cursor_expired` | Stream cursor expired (Horizon or Soroban) |

For `engine.cursor_expired` notifications, the payload includes:
- `lostCursor?: string` - The value of the expired or lost cursor.
- `source?: "horizon" | "soroban"` - The subscription engine source where the expiry occurred.

Consumers can subscribe to these via `watcher.on("engine.reconnecting", …)`
to surface UI banners or write structured logs.

### In-process backpressure and bounded queues

To protect consumers from unbounded memory growth when a watcher is slow or
there's a burst of ledger activity, `EventEngine` now maintains a bounded
internal queue. Configuration lives in `CoreConfig.queue` and exposes three
knobs:

- **`highWaterMark`**: the maximum queued events before backpressure triggers (default: 10000).
- **`lowWaterMark`**: the level below which backpressure is considered cleared (default: 50% of highWaterMark).
- **`policy`**: one of `pause` (default), `drop-oldest`, or `drop-newest`.

When the high-water mark is crossed the engine emits `engine.backpressure`
with `{ active: true, queued, policy }`. The default `pause` policy stops
the underlying sources (Horizon and Soroban) until the queue drains below the
low-water mark, at which point `engine.backpressure` with `{ active: false }`
is emitted and sources are resumed. `drop-oldest` and `drop-newest` shed
events deterministically instead of pausing the source; these are useful for
best-effort dashboards where availability is preferred over perfect delivery.

---

## 6. Webhook delivery internals

`WebhookDelivery` is a thin wrapper around `fetch` with five concerns:

1. **Signing.** HMAC-SHA256 over `${timestamp}.${payload}`, where `payload`
   is the JSON-serialized `NormalizedEvent`. The signature is hex-encoded
   and sent as the `x-orbital-signature` header. The timestamp prevents
   replay attacks; receivers should reject signatures older than a small
   window (recommended: 5 minutes).
2. **Timeout.** Each attempt has an `AbortController` cap (default 10 s,
   tunable via `deliveryTimeoutMs`). A timed-out attempt counts as a failure
   and triggers retry.
3. **Retry.** On any non-2xx response, network error, or timeout, the
   delivery schedules a retry after a jittered exponential delay (`2^(n-1)
   × 1000ms × Math.random()`). The default cap is 3 attempts.
4. **Concurrent-retry cap.** If too many endpoints are slow, retries can
   accumulate and exhaust memory. The cap (`maxConcurrentRetries`, default
   100) evicts the *newest* pending retry first when the limit is hit and
   emits a synthetic `webhook.dropped` event so consumers can route it to a
   dead-letter store.
5. **Terminal failure.** After all retries are exhausted, the delivery
   emits `webhook.failed` on the watcher with `{ error, url, attempts,
   originalEvent }` in `raw`. The watcher's `on("webhook.failed", …)`
   handler is the dead-letter integration point.

### SSRF safety

Delivery targets are validated at construction time and re-validated against
DNS resolution before each request. Loopback (`127.0.0.0/8`, `::1`), private
RFC 1918 ranges, and link-local (`169.254.0.0/16`) addresses are blocked by
default. Setting `allowPrivateNetworks: true` opts out - useful for local
development, never appropriate for production.

### Edge-runtime verification

`verifyWebhookEdge` is a parallel implementation of `verifyWebhook` that
uses Web Crypto's `crypto.subtle.sign` instead of Node's `createHmac`. It
runs on Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge, Deno, and browsers - anywhere with
the standard `crypto.subtle` API. The constant-time XOR comparison
substitutes for Node's `timingSafeEqual`.

This matters because the most common webhook receiver shape on Stellar
today is a Cloudflare Worker or a Vercel Edge route, and the Node crypto
verifier doesn't load there.

---

## 7. React hook internals

`useStellarEvent<T>` is intentionally thin: it acquires a pooled
`EventSource` connection and applies a per-hook event filter, with three
design choices worth noting.

**Connection pooling.** Hook instances with the same `serverUrl`, `address`,
and `token` share one browser `EventSource`; the pool closes that connection
when the last hook using the key unmounts.

**Stable dep-array.** An array literal passed as the `event` allowlist
would otherwise be a new reference every render and re-run the effect
continuously. The hook serializes the allowlist to a sorted string
(`eventKey`) and uses that as the dep instead.

**Dual call signature.** The hook accepts both a config object
(`useStellarEvent({ serverUrl, address, event })`) and a positional form
(`useStellarEvent(serverUrl, address, { event })`). The two are normalized
to the same four primitives before the effect runs.

**Generic type narrowing.** Passing a narrower union as `T` lets consumers
exhaustively switch on `event.type` without manual casts:

```tsx
type WalletEvents = Extract<NormalizedEvent, { type: "payment.received" | "payment.sent" }>;
const { event } = useStellarEvent<WalletEvents>(url, address, { event: ["payment.received", "payment.sent"] });
```

The hook is browser-only - `EventSource` doesn't exist in Node. In Next.js
App Router, mark consuming components with `"use client"`. In Remix or Vite
SSR, gate the hook behind a client-only boundary.

---

## 8. Trust boundaries and invariants

| Boundary | Inside | Outside | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Webhook signature** | The signed `${timestamp}.${payload}` body emitted by `WebhookDelivery`. | Network, intermediate proxies, the receiver's logs. | HMAC-SHA256 with a shared secret; `verifyWebhook` uses timing-safe comparison. |
| **Webhook target URL** | The host configured by the operator. | The DNS resolver and the network it points at. | SSRF block-list on construction *and* re-validated post-DNS to defend against DNS rebinding. |
| **SSE stream from Stellar** | `EventEngine` → `Watcher` callbacks. | Horizon, intermediate CDNs. | The engine treats every record as untrusted input - every field is `typeof`-checked before normalization; malformed records are dropped with a warn log, not thrown. |
| **API key on the demo backend** | A single `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK`-validated singleton. | Public internet, every visitor. | The demo enforces a 1-stream-per-IP concurrency cap and a 25s session timer; production self-hosters should swap in their own auth (the SDKs do not prescribe one). |
| **HMAC secret** | The operator's secret store. | Source control, logs, debug output. | The reference composition reads from env; consumers are expected to use a secrets manager. |

### Invariants

- An `EventEngine` only ever holds one upstream connection at a time.
  `start()` is idempotent (returns `false` if already running, unless
  `strict: true` is passed).
- A `Watcher` only ever delivers to a given subscriber once per event.
- A `WebhookDelivery` retries each URL independently; one slow endpoint
  does not block delivery to the others.
- A stopped `Watcher` accepts no new listeners and emits no further events.
  Adding a listener after `stop()` is a no-op with a warn log.

---

## 9. Reference composition (`apps/web`)

The marketing site doubles as the runnable reference for "how do I wire
this together end-to-end?" Two API routes show the composition:

| Route | Powers | Cost-control |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/events/[address]` | The on-page Live Demo. Subscribes to the address, streams events as SSE, closes after the session cap. | 1 concurrent stream per IP; 25s max session. |
| `POST /api/webhook-sample` | The on-page Webhook Demo. Returns a real HMAC-SHA256-signed sample payload with `x-orbital-*` headers. | 1 signing request per IP per 20s. |

Both routes share a lazy `globalThis`-scoped `EventEngine` singleton
(`apps/web/lib/engine.ts`) that survives Next.js HMR. When the limits
trigger, the routes return a JSON envelope
(`{ error: "demo_limit_reached", reason, message, upgradeUrl }`) that the
React components surface as an "Upgrade to Orbital Cloud" CTA.

For production self-hosting, copy the route handlers, strip the limit
checks in `lib/demo-limits.ts`, and swap the in-memory singleton for a
proper process manager. The whole composition is under 200 lines of TS.

---

## 10. Shipped since Phase 0, and what's still ahead

The following bolted on without changing the public API surface consumers
already depend on:

- **Soroban event subscription.** A second source feeding into the same
  normalization pipeline. New event types
  (`contract.invoked`, `contract.emitted`) join the `NormalizedEvent` union;
  existing consumers ignore them unless they call
  `engine.subscribeContract({ contractId, topics })`.
- **ABI Registry client.** Decodes Soroban event topics + data into typed,
  human-readable JSON via `decodedData` on `contract.emitted`. Lives in the
  separate `@orbital-stellar/abi-registry` package so the registry data layer
  is independently versioned.
- **Cursor persistence.** A pluggable `CursorStore` interface stored on
  `EventEngine` config. Implementations: in-memory (default), local file,
  Redis, Postgres, S3. On reconnect with a configured store, the engine
  resumes from the stored cursor instead of `"now"`.
- **Replay adapters.** A pluggable `RetryQueue` interface on
  `WebhookDelivery`. Implementations: in-memory (default), Redis, SQS.
  Pending retries survive process restarts when configured.

Consumers opt in by passing new config (`cursorStore`, `retryQueue`,
`soroban`) - existing `on()` handlers are unaffected.

Still ahead (tracked in [`ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md) Wave 1.4–1.5):

- **Discriminated union refinement.** Today the `NormalizedEvent` union is
  discriminated by `type` but several fields are `unknown` for type-safety
  reasons (the raw Horizon record). A future pass narrows these to typed
  shapes with the help of generated schemas from Horizon's OpenAPI.
- **`STABILITY.md`** - a formal semver contract and deprecation window,
  the last gate before a `v1.0.0` tag.

## Performance benchmarks

The hot path of every event is normalization plus, for Soroban contract events,
spec resolution and decoding. A change that halves throughput there would ship
unnoticed without a guard, so `packages/pulse-core/bench/` holds a benchmark
suite that CI runs on every packages change and gates on regressions.

### What is measured

The suite runs four things against the recorded CAP-67 fixture corpus in
`packages/pulse-core/test/fixtures/cap67/`, so the numbers reflect pulse-core's
own work rather than network time:

- **normalize/raw-to-normalized** - a raw RPC event through `normalizeContractEvent`.
- **decode/cap67-transfer** - the CAP-67 unified `transfer` decoder over the
  transfer fixtures (bare `i128` and `SCMap`-with-memo forms).
- **watcher/fan-out-1, -100, -1000** - `Watcher.emit` dispatch at each fan-out width.
- **cursor/memory-set** and **cursor/memory-set-many-100** - cursor write cost
  for the in-memory adapter, single-key and batched.

### Running it
`bench` exits non-zero when any case is more than 20% slower than the committed
baseline, or when a baselined case has gone missing. Improvements never fail.
The harness is dependency-free (`node:perf_hooks` only) and reports the median of
many batched samples, so a single GC pause does not trip the gate.

### The baseline and how to update it

`packages/pulse-core/bench/baseline.json` is the committed reference. It records
each case's throughput alongside the machine the numbers came from, because a
throughput figure is meaningless without the hardware behind it.

Updating the baseline is deliberate. When a change legitimately moves the
numbers - a faster algorithm, or an accepted cost for new behavior - regenerate
the baseline with `bench:update` and **justify the change in the pull request
body**: what moved, why, and roughly by how much. A baseline bump without a
reason in the PR is treated as a red flag in review, because it is the one way a
real regression can be laundered into the reference.

The current committed baseline was generated on a developer workstation and is
noisier than a dedicated runner would produce; regenerate it on stable hardware
when convenient and record that environment here.
