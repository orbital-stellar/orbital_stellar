## 1. Watch an account for incoming payments

The shortest path. Subscribe, attach a handler, wait for events. ✅

```ts
import { EventEngine } from "@orbital-stellar/pulse-core";

const engine = new EventEngine({ network: "testnet" });
engine.start();

const watcher = engine.subscribe("GABC...YOUR_ACCOUNT");

watcher.on("payment.received", (event) => {
  console.log(`+${event.amount} ${event.asset} from ${event.from}`);
});
```

Send a test payment from the [Stellar Laboratory](https://laboratory.stellar.org) and the event prints within seconds. `engine.stop()` cleanly closes the upstream connection - always call it in your shutdown path.

---

## 2. Subscribe to multiple addresses with one engine

One Horizon connection, many watchers. The engine fans events out internally - no extra network cost per subscriber. ✅

```ts
import { EventEngine } from "@orbital-stellar/pulse-core";

const engine = new EventEngine({ network: "mainnet" });
engine.start();

const accounts = ["GABC...", "GDEF...", "GHIJ..."];

for (const address of accounts) {
  const watcher = engine.subscribe(address);
  watcher.on("*", (event) => {
    console.log(`[${address.slice(0, 8)}] ${event.type}`);
  });
}
```

`engine.subscribe()` is idempotent - calling it twice for the same address returns the same `Watcher`. To stop watching one account without tearing down the stream: `engine.unsubscribe(address)`. To stop watching everything: `engine.unsubscribeAll()`.

---

## 3. Filter events with a predicate

Pass a `filter` function on `subscribe()` to suppress events you don't want delivered. The filter runs before any `on(…)` handler fires. ✅

```ts
import { EventEngine, type NormalizedEvent } from "@orbital-stellar/pulse-core";

const engine = new EventEngine({ network: "mainnet" });
engine.start();

const watcher = engine.subscribe("GABC...", {
  filter: (event: NormalizedEvent) =>
    event.type === "payment.received" &&
    Number(event.amount) >= 100, // ≥ 100 units, whatever the asset
});

watcher.on("payment.received", (event) => {
  console.log(`Large payment: ${event.amount} ${event.asset}`);
});
```

A predicate that throws is treated as `false` (suppress, with a warn log) - the engine never crashes on a bad filter.

---

## 4. Handle reconnection and rate-limit notifications

Lifecycle notifications surface alongside operation events on every watcher. Surface them as toasts, banners, or structured logs. ✅

```ts
import { EventEngine } from "@orbital-stellar/pulse-core";

const engine = new EventEngine({ network: "mainnet" });
engine.start();

const watcher = engine.subscribe("GABC...");

watcher.on("engine.reconnecting", (n) => {
  console.warn(`Reconnect attempt ${n.attempt}, delay ${n.delayMs}ms`);
});

watcher.on("engine.rate_limited", (n) => {
  console.warn(`Horizon rate-limited us. Backing off ${n.delayMs}ms`);
});

watcher.on("engine.reconnected", (n) => {
  console.info(`Stream restored on attempt ${n.attempt}`);
});

watcher.on("engine.stopped", () => {
  console.info("Engine stopped");
});
```

The engine parses `Retry-After` headers on 429 responses and uses that exact delay (falling back to 60 s if the header is missing).

---

## 5. Use a custom Horizon URL

Self-hosted node, regional mirror, or futurenet. The `network` field still picks the chain context; `horizonUrl` overrides the HTTP target. ✅

```ts
import { EventEngine } from "@orbital-stellar/pulse-core";

const engine = new EventEngine({
  network: "mainnet",
  horizonUrl: "https://horizon.your-node.example.com",
  reconnect: { initialDelayMs: 2000, maxDelayMs: 60_000 },
});

engine.start();
```

The URL must be `http://` or `https://`. The engine validates the URL at construction time and throws synchronously if it's malformed - you get a fast error, not a silent SSE failure.

---

## 6. Deliver events to an HTTPS endpoint

`WebhookDelivery` attaches to a watcher and POSTs every event to your endpoint with HMAC-SHA256 signing, exponential backoff retry, and a configurable per-attempt timeout. ✅

**Sender side** - attach delivery to the watcher:

```ts
import { EventEngine } from "@orbital-stellar/pulse-core";
import { WebhookDelivery } from "@orbital-stellar/pulse-webhooks";

const engine = new EventEngine({ network: "mainnet" });
engine.start();

const watcher = engine.subscribe("GABC...");

new WebhookDelivery(watcher, {
  url: "https://your-app.com/hooks/stellar",
  secret: process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET!,
  retries: 3,
  deliveryTimeoutMs: 10_000,
});
```

**Receiver side** - verify the signature and enforce the replay window with `maxAgeMs`:

```ts
import { verifyWebhook } from "@orbital-stellar/pulse-webhooks";
import express from "express";

const app = express();

app.post(
  "/hooks/stellar",
  express.raw({ type: "application/json" }),
  (req, res) => {
    const signature = req.header("x-orbital-signature");
    const timestamp = req.header("x-orbital-timestamp");
    if (!signature || !timestamp) return res.sendStatus(400);

    const event = verifyWebhook(
      req.body.toString(),
      signature,
      process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET!,
      timestamp,
      { maxAgeMs: 5 * 60 * 1000 }, // reject signatures older than 5 minutes
    );
    if (!event) return res.sendStatus(401);

    console.log(`Verified ${event.type}`);
    res.sendStatus(200);
  },
);
```

Each request carries `x-orbital-signature` (hex HMAC-SHA256 over `${timestamp}.${body}`), `x-orbital-timestamp`, and `x-orbital-attempt`. Always pass `maxAgeMs` to bound replay - a signature without a replay window is valid indefinitely. The default is `300_000` (5 minutes), matching the recommendation in `SECURITY.md`.

---

## 7. Verify a webhook in a Cloudflare Worker

`verifyWebhookEdge` uses Web Crypto, so it runs on Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge, Deno, and browsers - anywhere without Node's `crypto` module. ✅

```ts
import { verifyWebhookEdge } from "@orbital-stellar/pulse-webhooks";

export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: { WEBHOOK_SECRET: string }) {
    if (request.method !== "POST") {
      return new Response("Method not allowed", { status: 405 });
    }

    const signature = request.headers.get("x-orbital-signature");
    const timestamp = request.headers.get("x-orbital-timestamp");
    if (!signature || !timestamp) {
      return new Response("Missing headers", { status: 400 });
    }

    const payload = await request.text();
    const event = await verifyWebhookEdge(
      payload,
      signature,
      env.WEBHOOK_SECRET,
      timestamp,
      { maxAgeMs: 5 * 60 * 1000 }, // reject signatures older than 5 minutes
    );
    if (!event) return new Response("Invalid signature", { status: 401 });

    // event is a verified, typed NormalizedEvent
    console.log(`Verified ${event.type}`);
    return new Response("ok");
  },
};
```

The verifier returns `null` on any failure (bad signature, malformed timestamp, bad JSON) - fail closed, never assume success.

---

## 8. Fan out one event to multiple URLs

`WebhookDelivery.config.url` accepts an array. Each URL retries independently - one slow endpoint does not block delivery to the others. ✅

```ts
new WebhookDelivery(watcher, {
  url: [
    "https://primary.your-app.com/hooks/stellar",
    "https://staging.your-app.com/hooks/stellar",
    "https://analytics.your-app.com/hooks/stellar",
  ],
  secret: process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET!,
  retries: 3,
});
```

The `webhook.failed` event (see recipe 9) fires per-URL, so you can detect which endpoint is sick and route accordingly.

---

## 9. Route `webhook.failed` to a dead-letter queue

When a delivery exhausts its retries, the watcher emits `webhook.failed` with the original event in `raw.originalEvent` and the failed URL in `raw.url`. Catch it and persist to a DLQ. ✅

```ts
import { EventEngine, type NormalizedEvent } from "@orbital-stellar/pulse-core";
import { WebhookDelivery, type WebhookFailureRaw } from "@orbital-stellar/pulse-webhooks";

const engine = new EventEngine({ network: "mainnet" });
engine.start();

const watcher = engine.subscribe("GABC...");

new WebhookDelivery(watcher, {
  url: "https://flaky.your-app.com/hooks/stellar",
  secret: process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET!,
  retries: 3,
});

watcher.on("webhook.failed", async (event) => {
  const { url, error, attempts, originalEvent } = event.raw as WebhookFailureRaw;
  await persistToDLQ({
    url,
    error,
    attempts,
    event: originalEvent,
    failedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  });
});

declare function persistToDLQ(record: unknown): Promise<void>;
```

`webhook.dropped` fires when the concurrent-retry cap evicts a pending retry - handle it the same way if you care about every miss.

---

## 10. Capture an anchor audit trail

Compose `CursorStore` + `RetryQueue` + `DeadLetterStore` to capture payment and trustline events for a set of anchor distribution accounts into an append-only audit log. The result is replay-safe: `replay --from <cursor>` rebuilds the audit log byte-identically from any point. ✅

```ts
import { EventEngine, FileCursorStore, type NormalizedEvent } from "@orbital-stellar/pulse-core";
import { MemoryRetryQueue, MemoryDeadLetterStore } from "@orbital-stellar/pulse-webhooks";
import { createWriteStream } from "fs";

// 1. Durable cursor store: survives process restarts.
const cursorStore = new FileCursorStore("./.orbital-cursors");

// 2. Retry queue: backs webhook delivery retries (swap for RedisRetryQueue in
//    production so retries survive restarts).
const retryQueue = new MemoryRetryQueue();

// 3. Dead-letter store: terminal failure persistence (swap for
//    PostgresDeadLetterStore in production for durability).
const deadLetter = new MemoryDeadLetterStore();

const engine = new EventEngine({
  network: "testnet",
  cursorStore,
  streamKey: "anchor-audit",
});
engine.start();

// Anchor distribution accounts to monitor.
const accounts = ["GABC...", "GDEF..."];

// Append-only audit log (JSON Lines, sorted keys for deterministic output).
const auditLog = createWriteStream("./audit.jsonl", { flags: "a" });

for (const account of accounts) {
  const watcher = engine.subscribe(account, {
    filter: (event: NormalizedEvent): boolean =>
      event.type === "payment.received" ||
      event.type === "payment.sent" ||
      event.type === "trustline.added" ||
      event.type === "trustline.removed",
  });

  watcher.on("*", (event) => {
    const raw = event.raw as Record<string, unknown> | undefined;
    const [ledgerStr, opIdxStr] = (raw?.id as string ?? "0-0").split("-");

    const record = {
      ledger: parseInt(ledgerStr, 10),
      txHash: extractTxHash(raw),
      operationIndex: parseInt(opIdxStr, 10),
      memo: (raw?.memo as string) ?? null,
      asset: event.asset,
      from: "from" in event ? event.from : event.account,
      to: "to" in event ? event.to : event.asset.split(":")[1] ?? "",
      eventType: event.type,
      timestamp: event.timestamp,
      raw: event.raw,
    };

    // Stable JSON: sorted keys for byte-identical replay.
    auditLog.write(JSON.stringify(record, sortedKeys) + "\n");
  });
}

function extractTxHash(raw?: Record<string, unknown>): string {
  const links = raw?._links as Record<string, unknown> | undefined;
  const txHref = links?.transaction as Record<string, unknown> | undefined;
  if (typeof txHref?.href === "string") {
    return txHref.href.split("/").pop() ?? "";
  }
  return "";
}

function sortedKeys(_key: string, value: unknown): unknown {
  if (value !== null && typeof value === "object" && !Array.isArray(value)) {
    const sorted: Record<string, unknown> = {};
    for (const k of Object.keys(value).sort()) {
      sorted[k] = (value as Record<string, unknown>)[k];
    }
    return sorted;
  }
  return value;
}

// Graceful shutdown.
process.on("SIGTERM", () => { auditLog.end(); engine.stop(); });
```

**Delivery guarantee: at-least-once with idempotency keys.** The composition of `CursorStore` + `RetryQueue` + `DeadLetterStore` provides at-least-once semantics, not exactly-once. Consumers MUST deduplicate by `(ledger, operationIndex)`. A process restart between event capture and cursor flush WILL produce duplicates on restart. For a full, production-shape `AnchorService` class that wraps this composition (with CLI and replay support), see [`examples/anchor-starter/`](../examples/anchor-starter/).

---

## 11. Render live payments in React with type narrowing

`useStellarEvent<T>` is generic - pass a narrow union as `T` to get full autocomplete and exhaustive `switch` checking. ✅

```tsx
"use client";
import { useStellarEvent } from "@orbital-stellar/pulse-notify";
import type { NormalizedEvent } from "@orbital-stellar/pulse-core";

type WalletEvents = Extract<
  NormalizedEvent,
  { type: "payment.received" | "payment.sent" | "trustline.added" }
>;

export function Wallet({ address }: { address: string }) {
  const { event, connected, error } = useStellarEvent<WalletEvents>(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ORBITAL_URL!,
    address,
    { event: ["payment.received", "payment.sent", "trustline.added"] },
  );

  if (error) return <p className="text-red-500">{error}</p>;
  if (!connected) return <p>Connecting…</p>;
  if (!event) return <p>Listening…</p>;

  switch (event.type) {
    case "payment.received":
      return <p>+{event.amount} {event.asset} from {event.from.slice(0, 8)}…</p>;
    case "payment.sent":
      return <p>−{event.amount} {event.asset} to {event.to.slice(0, 8)}…</p>;
    case "trustline.added":
      return <p>Added trustline for {event.asset}</p>;
  }
}
```

A `switch` over `event.type` with no `default` clause will produce a TypeScript error if you ever miss a case - the narrow union does the work.

---

## 12. Stand up an SSE endpoint in Next.js

The hooks expect a backend that re-emits Orbital events as Server-Sent Events. The marketing site ships a working reference at `apps/web/app/api/events/[address]/route.ts` - copy it, strip the demo limits in `apps/web/lib/demo-limits.ts`, and you have your production SSE handler. ✅

```ts
// app/api/events/[address]/route.ts
import { EventEngine } from "@orbital-stellar/pulse-core";

export const dynamic = "force-dynamic";
export const runtime = "nodejs";

const g = globalThis as unknown as { __engine?: EventEngine };
function engine() {
  if (!g.__engine) {
    g.__engine = new EventEngine({ network: "mainnet" });
    g.__engine.start();
  }
  return g.__engine;
}

export async function GET(
  req: Request,
  { params }: { params: Promise<{ address: string }> },
) {
  const { address } = await params;
  const watcher = engine().subscribe(address);
  const encoder = new TextEncoder();

  const stream = new ReadableStream({
    start(controller) {
      const send = (e: unknown) =>
        controller.enqueue(encoder.encode(`data: ${JSON.stringify(e)}\n\n`));
      const beat = setInterval(
        () => controller.enqueue(encoder.encode(`: heartbeat\n\n`)),
        30_000,
      );
      watcher.on("*", send);
      req.signal.addEventListener("abort", () => {
        clearInterval(beat);
        watcher.removeListener("*", send);
        engine().unsubscribe(address);
        controller.close();
      });
    },
  });

  return new Response(stream, {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "text/event-stream",
      "Cache-Control": "no-cache",
    },
  });
}
```

The `globalThis` trick keeps one `EventEngine` alive across Next.js HMR. In production (`next start`) it persists for the lifetime of the Node process. On Vercel serverless, expect periodic reconnects when the function instance recycles - fine for demos, not for production Cloud.

---

## 13. Subscribe to Soroban contract events

Subscribes to smart-contract events by contract ID and topic filter via Stellar RPC. Same normalized-event taxonomy as classic operations, with two new types: `contract.invoked` and `contract.emitted`.

```ts
import { EventEngine } from "@orbital-stellar/pulse-core";

const engine = new EventEngine({
  network: "mainnet",
  soroban: {
    rpcUrl: "https://soroban-rpc.your-node.example.com",
  },
});
engine.start();

const watcher = engine.subscribeContract({
  contractId: "CA...",
  topics: ["transfer"], // optional topic filter
});

watcher.on("contract.emitted", (event) => {
  console.log(event.contractId, event.topic, event.decodedData);
});
```

Decoding to typed `decodedData` requires the ABI Registry client (`@orbital-stellar/abi-registry`), wired in via `EventEngine`'s ABI registry config - see [`packages/abi-registry/README.md`](../packages/abi-registry/README.md). Without a registered ABI, raw XDR is exposed in `event.raw`.

---

## 14. Unit test webhooks with deterministic jitter

Inject a custom RNG into `WebhookDelivery` to make exponential backoff delays deterministic in your test suite. ✅

```ts
import { Watcher } from "@orbital-stellar/pulse-core";
import { WebhookDelivery } from "@orbital-stellar/pulse-webhooks";
import { vi } from "vitest";

// A simple seeded RNG for deterministic results
let seed = 12345;
const seededRandom = () => {
  seed = (seed * 16807) % 2147483647;
  return (seed - 1) / 2147483646;
};

const watcher = new Watcher("GABC...");

new WebhookDelivery(watcher, {
  url: "https://example.com/webhook",
  secret: "top-secret",
  retries: 3,
  random: seededRandom, // 👈 Inject RNG here
});
```

Combine this with `vi.useFakeTimers()` to verify that retries happen after the exact jittered delay you expect without waiting for real-world wall clock time.

---

## 15. Generate TypeScript types from a Soroban contract

Generate TypeScript type declarations and Zod schemas from a deployed Soroban contract's spec. ✅

### Using the CLI

```bash
# Generate types from a testnet contract
orbital typegen CBCG...YOUR_CONTRACT --out src/contract-types.ts

# Target mainnet with a custom RPC endpoint
orbital typegen CBCG...YOUR_CONTRACT \
  --network mainnet \
  --rpc-url https://soroban-mainnet.example.com \
  --out src/contract-types.ts
```

### Using the binary directly (standalone generate)

```bash
# If you already have a contract spec JSON file
abi-registry-generate ./my-contract-spec.json ./my-contract.d.ts
```

The `abi-registry-generate` binary takes a Soroban contract spec JSON file and outputs a `.d.ts` file with generated TypeScript types. It ships with `@orbital-stellar/abi-registry` and is available via `npx abi-registry-generate`.

---

## 16. Back up and restore cursor positions

Dump or restore cursor positions from a Postgres database for migration or disaster recovery. Requires the `pg` package installed separately. ✅

```bash
# Install the pg driver (if not already available)
npm install pg

# Dump all cursors as line-delimited JSON to a file
orbital cursor dump > cursors-backup.jsonl

# Restore cursors from the backup file
orbital cursor restore < cursors-backup.jsonl
```

The `cursor dump` command reads from the `cursor_store` table and outputs one JSON object per line. `cursor restore` reads the same format from stdin and writes back. Both commands connect to Postgres via the `PG*` environment variables (`PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, `PGDATABASE`, etc.) — the same ones `psql` uses.

---

## 17. Inspect or replay dead-letter-queue entries

When webhook deliveries fail after all retries, entries land in the dead-letter queue (DLQ). The `orbital-dlq` CLI lets you list, dump, and replay them. ✅

```bash
# List all DLQ entries for a specific URL
orbital-dlq dlq list --url https://your-app.com/hooks/stellar

# Filter entries since a timestamp with a limit
orbital-dlq dlq list \
  --url https://your-app.com/hooks/stellar \
  --since 2026-01-01T00:00:00Z \
  --limit 50

# Dump all DLQ entries as line-delimited JSON
orbital-dlq dlq dump

# Replay a specific DLQ entry (re-signs and re-delivers)
orbital-dlq dlq replay <entry-id> --secret "$WEBHOOK_SECRET"
```

The `orbital-dlq` binary ships with `@orbital-stellar/pulse-webhooks` and is available via `npx orbital-dlq`. Set `ORBITAL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in your environment or pass `--secret` to re-sign replayed deliveries.

---

## 18. Subscribe to contract-specific typed events in React

Use `orbital codegen` with a contract spec to generate per-event React hooks with
Zod runtime validation, then consume them in your components. ✅

**Step 1: Generate types and hooks from a registry spec**

```ts
import { generateContractArtifacts, generateContractHooks } from "@orbital-stellar/abi-registry";
import type { ContractSpec } from "@orbital-stellar/abi-registry";

// Load the spec - from a registry client, local file, or WASM discovery
const spec: ContractSpec = { /* ... contract spec ... */ };

const artifacts = generateContractArtifacts(spec);
// artifacts.declarations  → TypeScript interfaces + types
// artifacts.schemas        → Zod validation schemas
// artifacts.hooks          → React hook wrappers (e.g. useSwapExecuted)

// Or use the standalone hook generator:
const hooks = generateContractHooks(spec);
```

**Step 2: Use generated hooks in a React component**

```tsx
import { useContractEvent } from "@orbital-stellar/pulse-notify";
import { SwapExecutedEventSchema } from "./generated/MyContract";

function SwapActivity({ serverUrl, contractId }: { serverUrl: string; contractId: string }) {
  const { event, connected, error } = useContractEvent({
    serverUrl,
    contractId,
    topics: ["swap_executed"],
    schema: SwapExecutedEventSchema, // Zod validation
  });

  if (error) return <div>Error: {error}</div>;
  if (!connected) return <div>Connecting...</div>;
  if (!event) return <div>Waiting for swap events...</div>;

  // event.data is now validated and typed
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Swap executed: {JSON.stringify(event.data)}</p>
      <p>Ledger: {event.ledger}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Step 3: Use auto-generated hook wrappers (from `orbital codegen`)**

For contracts with registered schemas, `orbital codegen` emits named hooks
like `useSwapExecuted()` that wrap `useContractEvent` with the correct
Zod schema pre-applied:

```tsx
import { useSwapExecuted } from "@orbital-stellar/generated/MyContract";

function SwapWatcher({ serverUrl, contractId }: { serverUrl: string; contractId: string }) {
  const { event, connected } = useSwapExecuted({ serverUrl, contractId });

  if (event) {
    // event is typed as the SwapExecutedEvent interface
    return <div>Swapped at ledger {event.ledger}: {event.data.amount}</div>;
  }
  return <div>Watching for swaps...</div>;
}
```

**Connection lifecycle:**
- One SSE connection is shared per `(contractId, topics)` regardless of how
  many hook instances mount it - asserted by the test suite.
- When all hook instances unmount, the connection closes and the subscription
  count returns to zero.
---

## 19. Migrate from Horizon-only to unified ingestion

Every `v1.0.0` deployment ingests through Horizon SSE, implicitly - there was no other transport. Wave 1.6 adds the CAP-67 unified event stream (Stellar RPC) as a second transport for classic asset movements, selected by an `ingestion` flag. 🛠️

Migrate in three steps - `"horizon"` → `"auto"` → `"unified"` - verifying parity before each cut, and roll back by reversing the same flag. Nothing about your `NormalizedEvent` handlers changes: the taxonomy is identical on both transports, only the rail underneath moves.

> **What ships today.** The `ingestion` flag itself is 🛠️ ([`ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md), Wave 1.6). The pieces this recipe leans on - the unified transport lifecycle (`soroban.unifiedEvents`), the routing decision (`resolveFamilyTransport`), and the dedupe primitives (`deriveDedupeKey`, `DedupeWindow`) - ship today ✅, so steps 0 and 1 are runnable now and steps 2-3 are the flag flips they lead to.

### The three modes

| Mode | `payment` / `trustlineAuth` events | Every other family | Use it when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `"horizon"` | Horizon SSE | Horizon SSE | Default. Exactly `v1.0.0` behavior |
| `"auto"` | Unified stream, falling back to Horizon | Horizon SSE | Migrating, and as a steady-state safety net |
| `"unified"` | Unified stream | Horizon SSE | RPC-first, once you trust the parity numbers |

Only the `payment` and `trustlineAuth` families have CAP-67 equivalents. Offers, account options, account merges, manage data, bump sequence, trustline limits, claimable balances, and liquidity pools stay on Horizon in **every** mode - `"unified"` does not mean "no Horizon connection". Check any family against the routing matrix without starting an engine: ✅

```ts
import { resolveFamilyTransport } from "@orbital-stellar/pulse-core";

resolveFamilyTransport("payment", "unified"); // "unified"
resolveFamilyTransport("trustlineAuth", "unified"); // "unified"
resolveFamilyTransport("offer", "unified"); // "horizon" - no CAP-67 equivalent
resolveFamilyTransport("payment", "horizon"); // "horizon" - mode wins
```

### Step 0 - pin your current behavior explicitly

Make today's implicit default explicit before you change anything, so the migration is one visible diff rather than a default shifting under you on upgrade. 🛠️

```ts
import { EventEngine } from "@orbital-stellar/pulse-core";

const engine = new EventEngine({
  network: "mainnet",
  ingestion: "horizon", // same behavior as v1.0.0, now stated out loud
});

engine.start();
```

### Step 1 - run the unified transport in the shadow and check parity

Turn the unified poller on next to Horizon. It connects, reconnects, persists its own cursor, and reports status - but it does not deliver anything to your watchers, so your handlers cannot see a difference. That is what makes this the safe first move. ✅

```ts
import { EventEngine, FileCursorStore } from "@orbital-stellar/pulse-core";

const cursorStore = new FileCursorStore("./.orbital-cursors");

const engine = new EventEngine({
  network: "mainnet",
  soroban: {
    rpcUrl: "https://mainnet.sorobanrpc.com",
    unifiedEvents: true, // start the CAP-67 poller alongside Horizon SSE
  },
  cursorStore, // give the unified stream somewhere durable to checkpoint
});

engine.start();

// Parity signal: both sources should be running and advancing together.
setInterval(() => {
  const { horizon, unified } = engine.status().sources;
  console.log(
    JSON.stringify({
      msg: "ingestion.parity",
      horizon: { running: horizon.running, lastEventAt: horizon.lastEventAt },
      unified: { running: unified.running, lastEventAt: unified.lastEventAt },
    }),
  );
}, 30_000);
```

Watch the unified transport's own health too - lifecycle notifications carry `source: "unified"`, so you can separate RPC trouble from Horizon trouble: ✅

```ts
const watcher = engine.subscribe("GABC...");

watcher.on("engine.reconnecting", (n) => {
  if (n.source === "unified") {
    console.warn(`Unified RPC reconnect #${n.attempt}, delay ${n.delayMs}ms`);
  }
});

watcher.on("engine.rate_limited", (n) => {
  if (n.source === "unified") console.warn(`Unified RPC rate-limited ${n.delayMs}ms`);
});
```

Move on when, over a window you consider representative, `unified.lastEventAt` keeps pace with `horizon.lastEventAt` and `engine.reconnecting` from `source: "unified"` is quiet. A unified stream that is persistently behind or reconnecting is an RPC endpoint problem - fix it here, where it costs you nothing, not after the cut.

### Step 2 - cut to `"auto"`

`"auto"` serves asset movements from the unified stream while it is healthy and falls back to Horizon when it is not. Every other family keeps coming from Horizon as before. 🛠️

```ts
const engine = new EventEngine({
  network: "mainnet",
  ingestion: "auto",
  soroban: {
    rpcUrl: "https://mainnet.sorobanrpc.com",
    unifiedEvents: true,
  },
  cursorStore,
});

engine.start();
```

This is the first step that changes where your events actually come from. It is also the step that can produce brief double observation of the same movement - see [Dedupe during the transition](#dedupe-during-the-transition) below. Many deployments stop here permanently: `"auto"` is the mode with a fallback.

### Step 3 - cut to `"unified"`

`"unified"` removes the Horizon fallback for asset movements. If RPC is down, those events do not arrive by another route - you find out instead of silently degrading. 🛠️

```ts
const engine = new EventEngine({
  network: "mainnet",
  ingestion: "unified",
  soroban: {
    rpcUrl: "https://mainnet.sorobanrpc.com",
    unifiedEvents: true,
  },
  cursorStore,
});

engine.start();
```

Only take this step if you run an RPC endpoint you control or trust operationally. Horizon is still connected for the families with no CAP-67 equivalent, so this is a narrowing of the fallback, not a removal of Horizon.

### Rollback

Rollback is the same flag in reverse - `"unified"` → `"auto"` → `"horizon"` - plus a restart. There is no migration to undo and no state to reset, because each transport checkpoints to its own cursor key.

```ts
// Roll all the way back to v1.0.0 behavior.
const engine = new EventEngine({
  network: "mainnet",
  ingestion: "horizon",
  cursorStore,
});

engine.start();
```

Roll back on any of: asset-movement events arriving late relative to your Horizon baseline, sustained `engine.reconnecting` with `source: "unified"`, or a gap you can attribute to the RPC endpoint. Dropping to `"auto"` is usually enough - it restores the Horizon fallback without giving up the unified stream.

### Cursors across the switch

Each transport keeps its own cursor entry in the `CursorStore`, under its own key: ✅

| Transport | Key with `streamKey` set | Default key |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Horizon SSE | `<streamKey>` | `horizon:<network>` |
| Soroban contract events | `<streamKey>:soroban` | `soroban:<network>` |
| CAP-67 unified stream | `<streamKey>:unified` | `unified:<network>` |

Three consequences worth internalizing before you flip anything:

- **Switching modes never overwrites the Horizon cursor.** Rolling back resumes Horizon from where it was, not from `"now"` - which is exactly why rollback is cheap.
- **The two cursor values are not interchangeable.** A Horizon cursor is a paging token; a unified cursor is the RPC `getEvents` pagination cursor. Both are opaque - never copy one into the other's key, and never hand-edit either.
- **A first cut to `"auto"`/`"unified"` with no stored unified cursor starts the unified stream from the RPC's current position**, not from your Horizon cursor. Run step 1 long enough for the unified cursor to be checkpointed and warm before the cut, and the switch is seamless. Cut cold and the window between the two positions is a gap for asset-movement events.

Cursor durability rules are unchanged by any of this - `PostgresCursorStore` for active-active, the in-memory default for development only. See [`docs/cursor-format.md`](./cursor-format.md). Full unified-stream cursor semantics in `CursorStore`, including replay against `BACKFILL_STELLAR_ASSET_EVENTS` history, are tracked in Wave 1.6. 🛠️

### Dedupe during the transition

While both transports are live - `"auto"` steady state, an `"auto"` fallback recovery, or the moments either side of a cut - both can observe the same on-chain movement. Delivery is deduped on a key that is stable across transports: a Horizon operation record and a CAP-67 unified event for the same movement derive the *same* key, because both carry the transaction hash and the position within that transaction. ✅

```ts
import { deriveDedupeKey, DedupeWindow } from "@orbital-stellar/pulse-core";

const window = new DedupeWindow(10_000); // bounded: oldest key evicted at capacity

const key = deriveDedupeKey({ txHash: "abc123...", index: 0 });
if (window.seenBefore(key)) return; // already delivered by the other transport
```

The guarantee is **at-most-once delivery within the window**, not globally. `DedupeWindow` is bounded by design - memory stays flat no matter how many keys pass through - so a duplicate separated by more than `capacity` intervening events is not caught. Size the capacity above the number of events you expect inside your longest fallback flap, and keep your handlers idempotent regardless. Wiring this into the engine's delivery path ahead of watcher fan-out is 🛠️; the key derivation and window are usable now.
