# Cursor Management

Durable cursors allow an `EventEngine` to resume a stream from the exact point it left off after a restart or crash. Without a cursor store, the engine defaults to `"now"`, which can lead to missed events during downtime.

## Cursor Format

A cursor is an opaque string representing a position in the Stellar ledger history.

- **Horizon (Classic)**: Cursors are paging tokens (e.g., `"1234567890-1"`).
- **Soroban (Contract Events)**: Cursors are composed of ledger sequence, entry index, and event type.
- **Unified stream (CAP-67)**: Cursors are the Soroban RPC `getEvents` pagination cursor returned alongside each page (e.g., `"0015933813272113152-0000000000"`) - a `toid`-style value that lexically sorts the same order as the ledger/transaction/operation position it encodes, so two cursors can be compared as plain strings without decoding them. Stored under its own key, independent of the Horizon and (contract-event) Soroban cursors for the same network - see below.

The `CursorStore` interface treats every cursor as an opaque string regardless of source. You should never attempt to parse or modify a cursor string manually.

### Unified-stream cursor key

`EventEngine` persists the unified poller's cursor under its own `CursorStore` key so it advances independently of the Horizon and Soroban (contract-event) cursors for the same network:

- `unified:${network}` by default (e.g. `unified:testnet`).
- `${streamKey}:unified` when a custom `streamKey` is configured.

This required no `CursorStore` interface change - the store already treats cursors as opaque per-key strings, so the unified transport is just a third key alongside the existing `horizon:${network}` / `soroban:${network}` (or `${streamKey}` / `${streamKey}:soroban`) ones. `migrateCursors` needs no changes either, for the same reason: it copies every key it finds, without any source-specific handling.

## Consistency Model

Different storage backends provide different consistency and durability guarantees. Choosing the right store depends on your deployment architecture.

### Postgres (`PostgresCursorStore`)

- **Consistency**: Strong.
- **Guarantee**: Write-after-read consistency is guaranteed by the database transaction and row-level locking (upsert).
- **Deployment**: **Recommended for active-active (high availability) deployments.** 
- **Details**: Multiple instances of Orbital can safely coordinate via a shared Postgres instance. The strong consistency ensures that if one instance crashes and another takes over, it will always see the latest written cursor.

### S3 (Planned)

- **Consistency**: Eventual.
- **Guarantee**: S3 provides read-after-write consistency for new objects but eventual consistency for updates in some regions/conditions (though modern S3 is mostly strongly consistent, the latency can lead to race conditions in high-concurrency handoffs).
- **Deployment**: **Recommended for active-passive (failover) deployments only.**
- **Details**: In an active-passive setup, only one engine is writing to the cursor at a time. During a failover, there is a small window where the passive instance might read a slightly stale cursor if the active instance just updated it.

### In-Memory (Default)

- **Consistency**: None (Lossy).
- **Guarantee**: None.
- **Deployment**: **Development and testing only.**
- **Details**: Cursors are lost on process restart. Use this only when event gaps are acceptable.

## Summary Table

| Store | Consistency Model | Deployment Recommendation | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Postgres** | Strong | Active-Active | Production / High Availability |
| **S3** | Eventual | Active-Passive Only | Low-cost / Failover |
| **In-Memory** | N/A | Local Development | Testing / Prototyping |

## Deployment Recommendations

### High Availability (Active-Active)

If you run multiple instances of `EventEngine` for the same set of addresses (e.g., behind a load balancer or for redundancy), you **must** use a strongly consistent store like **Postgres**. This prevents "phantom reads" and duplicate event processing that can occur if two instances disagree on the current cursor position.

### Failover (Active-Passive)

If you run a primary and a standby instance, where the standby only starts once the primary is confirmed dead, an eventually consistent store like **S3** is acceptable. The failover delay usually exceeds the consistency window of the storage provider.

## Live Migration Between Stores

When moving from one cursor store to another (e.g., file → Redis at scale-up), use the built-in `migrateCursors` utility to copy all existing cursors atomically.

### Recommended sequence

1. **Stop the engine** - call `engine.stop()` and wait for it to resolve so no new cursors are written during the copy.
2. **Run the migration**:
   ```ts
   import { migrateCursors } from "@orbital-stellar/pulse-core";

   const result = await migrateCursors(oldStore, newStore);
   console.log(`Migrated ${result.migrated} cursor(s)`);
   ```
3. **Restart with the new store** - update `cursorStore` in your `EventEngine` config to point at the new store and call `engine.start()`.
4. **Remove the old store** once the engine has confirmed healthy operation on the new store.

### Idempotency

The migration is **idempotent** - running it multiple times overwrites the target entries with the same source values. This lets you retry the migration safely if it is interrupted.
