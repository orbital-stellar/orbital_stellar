# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

This file rolls up changes across the public packages: `@orbital-stellar/pulse-core`,
`@orbital-stellar/pulse-webhooks`, `@orbital-stellar/pulse-notify`, and `@orbital-stellar/abi-registry`.
Per-package changelogs live in each package directory.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `STABILITY.md` - strict semver on the public API of all `@orbital-stellar/*`
  packages, wire/data contracts covered (webhook headers, HMAC scheme, retry
  semantics, `NormalizedEvent` JSON shape, cursor format, registry schema
  format), a 6-month deprecation window, and a documented security exception.
  Closes the outstanding Wave 1.5 release-gate item.
- [`docs/migration/0.1-to-1.0.md`](docs/migration/0.1-to-1.0.md) - procedural
  before/after migration guide for the `0.1.0` → `1.0.0` bump (breaking
  `abiRegistry` default, `decodedData` shape, Wave 8 registry configuration).
  Narrative release notes remain in this file’s `[1.0.0]` entry when cut;
  do not duplicate them into the guide.

### Changed

- **Roadmap refocused on the decoding standard.** Maintainer sign-off for
  scope removal per `ROADMAP.md`'s own contribution rules. The former Phase 2
  (SDK Ecosystem) is replaced by Phase 2 - The Decoding Standard (SEP draft,
  `orbital codegen`, semantic layer, hosted registry). `@orbital-stellar/anchor-sdk`
  is pulled forward into a new Phase 3 - Anchor Events. The former Phase 3
  (Trust & Agent Layer: x402, agent-sdk, intent compiler, shadow-fork) and
  Phase 4 (Protocol Permanence: identity layer, reactor library, 10+ SEPs)
  are frozen and moved to an explicit Frozen section in `ROADMAP.md` with
  per-item rationale and an unfreeze procedure. No shipped code is removed -
  planned scope only.
- Docs aligned with the refocused roadmap: README reframed around the
  decoding standard; open-source-policy and proposal forward-references
  updated; frozen-scope references removed from forward-looking docs.

### Fixed

### Security

- **`@orbital-stellar/anchor-sdk` 0.1.0 does not validate SEP-10 challenges
  before signing them.** `Sep10Client.authenticate()` passed the anchor's
  challenge XDR straight to the caller-supplied `sign` callback with no checks:
  no verification of the anchor's signature, no source-account or `sequence == 0`
  check, no `<home_domain> auth` Manage Data check, no time bounds. The
  `network_passphrase` in the response was parsed and then ignored, and
  `SIGNING_KEY` — the one value that can attribute a challenge to an anchor —
  was read from `stellar.toml` and never used.

  A hostile or compromised anchor, or an on-path attacker against a plain-`http`
  `WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT`, could return an ordinary transaction (a payment, or a
  `set_options` adding a signer) and have it blind-signed by the consumer's
  wallet, hardware device, or KMS.

  Fixed in **0.2.0**. `Sep10Client` now verifies every challenge with
  `WebAuth.readChallengeTx` before `sign` is invoked, rejects a
  `network_passphrase` that disagrees with the configured network, and refuses a
  non-`https` endpoint at construction.

  This is a **breaking change to a surface that was itself the vulnerability**,
  taken under the security exception in [`STABILITY.md`](./STABILITY.md).
  A GitHub Security Advisory is to be published per [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md).

  **Migration.** `Sep10Client` now requires the anchor's identity. The smallest
  change is to build it from the anchor's own `stellar.toml`:

  ```ts
  // before - no way to tell whose challenge you were signing
  const client = new Sep10Client(toml.WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT);

  // after - SIGNING_KEY and NETWORK_PASSPHRASE come from the toml you already fetch
  const toml = await discoverAnchor("anchor.example");
  const client = Sep10Client.fromToml(toml, "anchor.example");
  ```

  Or pass them explicitly: `new Sep10Client(endpoint, { serverAccountId,
  networkPassphrase, homeDomain, webAuthDomain })`. Anchors that publish no
  `SIGNING_KEY` are now refused rather than trusted.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-28

First versioned release. The three packages cover the full Stellar classic
operation taxonomy and are stable for testnet development today. Soroban
event subscription, cursor persistence, and the `v1.0` stability pledge ship
in Phase 1 (Q2–Q3 2026).

### Added

- `@orbital-stellar/pulse-core`: `EventEngine` - Horizon SSE subscription with AWS
  Full-Jitter exponential backoff, automatic reconnection, and a per-address
  `Watcher` pub/sub model built on Node's `EventEmitter`.
- `@orbital-stellar/pulse-core`: full classic operation taxonomy normalized into a
  typed `NormalizedEvent` discriminated union:
  - Payments: `payment.received`, `payment.sent`, `payment.self`
  - Accounts: `account.created`, `account.merged`, `account.options_changed`,
    `account.bump_sequence`
  - Trustlines: `trustline.added`, `trustline.updated`, `trustline.removed`,
    `trustline.authorized`, `trustline.deauthorized`
  - DEX offers: `offer.created`, `offer.updated`, `offer.deleted`
  - Claimable balances: `claimable.created`, `claimable.claimed`
  - Liquidity pools: `lp.deposited`, `lp.withdrawn`
  - Data entries: `data.set`, `data.cleared`
- `@orbital-stellar/pulse-core`: lifecycle notifications - `engine.reconnecting`,
  `engine.reconnected`, `engine.rate_limited` (with parsed `Retry-After`),
  and `engine.stopped`.
- `@orbital-stellar/pulse-core`: `CoreConfig.horizonUrl` override for self-hosted
  Horizon nodes, regional mirrors, and futurenet.
- `@orbital-stellar/pulse-core`: `EventEngine.unsubscribeAll()` to drain watchers
  without closing the SSE stream.
- `@orbital-stellar/pulse-core`: optional `filter` predicate on
  `EventEngine.subscribe()` for per-watcher event suppression.
- `@orbital-stellar/pulse-webhooks`: `WebhookDelivery` with HMAC-SHA256 signing
  (`x-orbital-signature`, `x-orbital-timestamp`, `x-orbital-attempt`),
  exponential-backoff retry with jitter, per-attempt `AbortController`
  timeout, and a concurrent-retry cap.
- `@orbital-stellar/pulse-webhooks`: `verifyWebhook` (Node `crypto`, timing-safe
  comparison) and `verifyWebhookEdge` (Web Crypto) for Cloudflare Workers,
  Vercel Edge, Deno, and browsers.
- `@orbital-stellar/pulse-notify`: `useStellarEvent<T>` with generic type narrowing,
  positional and config-object call signatures, and stable dep-array keys
  for array event allowlists.
- `@orbital-stellar/pulse-notify`: `useStellarPayment` and `useStellarActivity`
  convenience hooks.
- `@orbital-stellar/pulse-core`: testnet + mainnet network selectors via
  `network: "mainnet" | "testnet"`.

### Changed

- `@orbital-stellar/pulse-core`: `EventEngine.start()` now returns a boolean
  (`true` on a fresh start, `false` if the engine was already running). Pass
  `{ strict: true }` to throw `EngineAlreadyStartedError` instead.
- `@orbital-stellar/pulse-core`: `WatcherNotification.timestamp` renamed to
  `emittedAt` to distinguish it from the on-chain `created_at` timestamp
  used in operation events.
- `@orbital-stellar/pulse-core`: self-payments where `from === to` now emit a single
  `payment.self` event instead of separate `payment.received` and
  `payment.sent` events.

### Fixed

- `@orbital-stellar/pulse-webhooks`: cap concurrent retries to prevent unbounded
  memory growth when consumer endpoints are unreachable.
- `@orbital-stellar/pulse-core`: align reconnect attempt numbers across logs and
  `engine.reconnecting` notifications.
- `@orbital-stellar/pulse-core`: warn when listeners are added after `Watcher.stop()`.

### Security

- `@orbital-stellar/pulse-webhooks`: timing-safe HMAC comparison via
  `crypto.timingSafeEqual` (Node) and constant-time XOR (Web Crypto).
- `@orbital-stellar/pulse-webhooks`: SSRF hardening on delivery targets - private,
  loopback, and link-local IP ranges are blocked by default, with DNS
  rebinding defense.
- Strict TypeScript across all packages (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`,
  `strict`, NodeNext module resolution).
- CI matrix runs on Node 20 and Node 22 with CodeQL static analysis and
  Dependabot CVE tracking.

### Impact

- Stellar developers can subscribe to every classic operation type with one
  typed API, deliver events to HTTPS endpoints with retry and signature
  verification baked in, and render live data in React without writing SSE
  plumbing.
- Edge-runtime verification unblocks webhook receivers on Cloudflare
  Workers and Vercel Edge - a deployment surface QuickNode and Moralis do
  not natively support for Stellar.
- The reference composition (`apps/web/app/api/events/[address]/route.ts`)
  is now a single Next.js file rather than a separate Express server, so
  there is one runtime to deploy when self-hosting the SDKs end-to-end.

### Known limitations (as of this release)

- Soroban contract events (`invoke_host_function`) are not yet normalized
  - Phase 1.
- Webhook retries are in-process; restarting loses pending retries.
  Persistent retry queues ship in Phase 1 alongside cursor persistence.
- Packages are not yet published to npm. Until `v0.1.0` is tagged and
  released, consume via `pnpm install` against the workspace.

> **Update (2026-07-06):** all three limitations above have since been resolved -
> Soroban event subscription, durable retry queues, and cursor persistence shipped
> (see `ROADMAP.md` Wave 1.1–1.3), and all four packages are now published to npm
> under the `@orbital-stellar` scope (published out-of-band; the `release.yml`
> npm-publish step is now uncommented for future version bumps).
