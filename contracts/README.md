# Orbital contracts

Soroban smart contracts backing Orbital's semantic layer. This is a standalone
Cargo workspace - it is **not** part of the pnpm workspace (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`
only globs `packages/*` and `apps/*`); it has its own toolchain and CI job.

## Contracts

- **`registry`** (`orbital-abi-registry`) - the on-chain ABI registry.
  `publish(publisher, contract_id, version, spec_hash, pointer)` records an
  immutable `(contract_id, publisher, version) -> SpecRecord` mapping, requires
  the publisher's authorization, and emits a `SpecPublished` event. Stores a
  hash + off-chain pointer, not the spec blob itself - integrity is verified by
  the caller re-hashing whatever it fetches from `pointer` and comparing it to
  `spec_hash`.
- **`demo-emitter`** (`orbital-demo-emitter`) - a tiny no-args `ping()` contract
  that emits a `Ping` event. Exists solely so the public `/demo/contracts` page
  can offer a "Fire test event" button without ever touching the registry
  contract's real publish path.

## Toolchain

Pinned via `rust-toolchain.toml`: stable channel, `wasm32v1-none` target.

**Note:** soroban-sdk 27's build script rejects the `wasm32-unknown-unknown`
target on Rust 1.82+ (reference-types/multi-value are enabled by default there
and unsupported by the Soroban environment) - use `wasm32v1-none` instead,
which has been available since Rust 1.84.

You'll also want the [Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/cli/install-cli)
(`stellar --version`) for deploying and interacting with contracts. Developed
against `stellar-cli 25.2.0` / `soroban-sdk 27.0.0`.

## Build & test

```sh
cd contracts
cargo test                                   # native unit tests (both contracts)
cargo build --release --target wasm32v1-none # production WASM build
```

WASM artifacts land in `target/wasm32v1-none/release/orbital_abi_registry.wasm`
and `target/wasm32v1-none/release/orbital_demo_emitter.wasm`.

CI (`.github/workflows/contracts.yml`) runs both on every push/PR that touches
`contracts/**`.

## Deploy to testnet

```sh
stellar keys generate orbital-deployer --network testnet --fund   # one-time
./deploy/deploy_testnet.sh
```

This is a manual, one-time act - contracts are immutable once deployed, so
deployment is intentionally not part of any CI pipeline. The script builds
both contracts, deploys them, and writes `deployed.testnet.json` with the
resulting contract IDs. See that script's header comment and the maintainer
plan's "manual/gated steps" section for the secret-provisioning steps that
follow (GitHub repo secrets for the nightly integration test, Vercel env vars
for the demo's "Fire test event" route).

## Deployment Provenance & Reproducible Builds

`contracts/deployed.testnet.json` serves as the trust anchor for the whole registry: consumers resolve specs through the contract ID it names. To prevent this file from drifting from the source in `contracts/registry`, CI enforces deployment provenance on every PR and push.

The procedure:
1. CI builds the contracts reproducibly using the pinned `rust-toolchain.toml` (ensuring byte-for-byte identical WASM across environments).
2. The `wasmHash` values recorded in `deployed.testnet.json` are compared against the newly built WASM hashes. A mismatch fails the job with a diff of expected vs actual.
3. The deployed WASM bytecodes are fetched directly from the Stellar testnet and hashed to ensure they exactly match the local build.

Changing contract source without redeploying turns the CI job red. If you intentionally modify a contract, you must rebuild, redeploy (which updates `deployed.testnet.json`), and commit both the source changes and the updated JSON file together.
